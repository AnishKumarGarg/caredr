                      <div class="faaltu_info panel-heading">I had to get an implant done for my front tooth. The procedure went quite well and all my expectations were met or exceeded by Dr Chandel and his team. I also approached Dr. Chandel for zirconium based capping, he was very professional and quite gifted at his craft.

                        You can get a lot of insight about an individualâ€™s integrity at the time of crisis, in my case the zirconium based crown fractured, Dr Chandel not only replaced the crown free of charge but also his approach to the whole issue was quite calm and his tone was calm and reassuring.
                        
                        His timely updates and reminders about appointment are extremely helpful.
                        
                        I donâ€™t have anything negative to report but in the interest of keeping opinion balanced Dr. Chandel charges are bit on the higher side, but in my humble opinion they are justified.</div>

                  <p class="kya_naam_doon">I have extracted my 1st molar and i want to fill the gap between premolar and 2nd molar by invisible braces how much time will it take and how much it will cost</p>
                  <div class="is_class_ko_kya_naam_doon"><div><p class="a1">Dr. Vinod Chandel answered</p></div>
                  <p>first and foremost important in senario is that gap has developed due to extraction of first molar as quoted in your  question
                    yeah your concern is correct on invisible braces it will defenately close back that gap and regain the space of extracted first molar
                    so advise is go for invisible treatment for closure of gap and regain of 1 st molar space and get implant in molar region ..it will be permanent solution
                    cost of invisiliner  will depend on time required for gap closure ..wch is determined only after analysis</p>
